# GTK bindings for the V Programming Language

Nothing serious yet, just exploring.

**Goal**

Write a native application for Gnome in vlang

**How**

Use gobject-introspection to generate the bindings.

Inspired by https://github.com/diamondburned/gotk4/

**Why**

vlang has an official ui but it does not look native, but more importantly it does not
support wayland. I love the gnome desktop and want to develop native looking apps for fun.
